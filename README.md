This quarter, I grade homework problems in Statistics 243 every day.
Only one problem of each set is graded, the number of which must be random, for fairness' sake.

This program takes in:
1) The book's section number
2) The number of problems
3) The problem numbers

It then puts out:
"From section " ,SECTION, "there are" ,NUMBER, "problems, which are the following:"

"[firstProblem, secondProblem, thirdProblem, ... ,nProblem]"

"The problem to grade is" ,iProblem, "."
